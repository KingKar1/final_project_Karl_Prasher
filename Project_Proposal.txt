Dataset: Craft Beer (includes beers.csv & breweries.csv)
Author: Karl Prasher

Problem Statement: Breweries need a good predictor model for the quality of
the beers based off the type of beer, location, .

Proposal 1: Using indictors such as location, type of beer, and others, I
plan to predict ABV and then cross reference against the ABV column to test
the model.

Proposal 2: Using the key indictors, predict the quality(beer scores) of beer
and cross reference against the scores at ratebeer.com.

Proposal 3: Determine where the most popular beer is located on the IBU scale.
Determine if location dictates where on IBU scale breweries make their beer.
